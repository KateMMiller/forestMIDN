\title{importData: Import views directly from MIDN forest database}
\usage{
importData(
  instance = c("local", "server"),
  server = "localhost",
  name = "MIDN_Forest",
  new_env = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{instance}{Specify whether you are connecting to the local instance or server.
\describe{
\item{"local"}{Default. Connects to local install of backend database}
\item{"server"}{Connects to main backend on server. Note that you must have permission to access the server, and
connection speeds are likely to be much slower than the local instance. You must also be connected to VPN or NPS network.}}}

\item{server}{Quoted name of the server to connect to, if instance = "server". Valid input is the server
address to connect to the main database. If connecting to the local instance, leave blank.}

\item{name}{Character. Specifies the name of the database. Default is "MIDN_Forest"}

\item{new_env}{Logical. Specifies which environment to store views in. If \code{TRUE}(Default), stores
views in VIEWS_MIDN environment. If \code{FALSE}, stores views in global environment}
}
\value{
MIDN database views in specified environment
}
\description{
This function imports all views in the ANALYSIS schema of the MIDN_Forest backend. Each view
is added to a VIEWS_MIDN environment in your workspace, or to your global environment based on whether
new_env = TRUE or FALSE. You must have the latest ODBC SQL driver installed for this function to
work. It can be downloaded from: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2168524
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Import using default settings of local instance, server = 'localhost' and add VIEWS_MIDN environment
importData()

# Import using computer name (# should be real numbers)
importData(server = "INPNETN-######", new_env = TRUE)

# Import from main database on server
importData(server = "INP###########\\\\########", instance = "server", new_env = TRUE)
}
