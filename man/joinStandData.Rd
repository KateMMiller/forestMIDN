\arguments{
\item{park}{Combine data from all parks or one or more parks at a time. Valid inputs:
\describe{

\item{QAQC}{Allows you to remove or include QAQC events.
\describe{
\item{FALSE}{Default. Only returns visits that are not QAQC visits}
\item{TRUE}{Returns all visits, including QAQC visits}}}

\item{locType}{Allows you to only include plots that are part of the GRTS sample design or include all plots, such as deer exclosures
\describe{
\item{"VS"}{Only include plots that are part of the Vital Signs GRTS sample design}
\item{"all"}{Include all plots, such as plots in deer exclosures or test plots.}}}

\item{panels}{Allows you to select individual panels from 1 to 4. Default is all 4 panels (1:4).
If more than one panel is selected, specify by c(1, 3), for example.}

\item{from}{Year to start analysis, ranging from 2007 to current year}

\item{to}{Year to stop analysis, ranging from 2007 to current year}

\item{eventType}{Allows you to include only complete sampling events or all sampling events
\describe{
\item{"complete"}{Default. Only include sampling events for a plot that are complete.}
\item{"all}{Include all plot events with a record in tblCOMN.Event, including plots missing most of the data
associated with that event (eg ACAD-029.2010). This feature is currently hard-coded in the function.}}}

\item{output}{Allows you to return all columns or just the most important columns for analysis. Valid
inputs are "short" and "verbose".}

\value{
returns a dataframe with stand data attached to location and event data. Field names starting with "Pct" are midpoints
between cover class ranges (e.g., 62.5 is the midpoint for 50-75%). Field names starting with "Txt" define the cover classes.
}
\description{
This function combines stand-level data for each plot, including cover by strata,
plot slope, canopy cover, etc. Must run importData first.
}
\examples{
importData()
# import 4 years of BOWA stand data
stand_df <- joinStandData(park = 'BOWA', from = 2015, to = 2019)

# import all visits, including QAQC, from 2019 in FRSP. Only return important data fields.
frsp_stand <- joinStandData(park = FRSP, from = 2019, to = 2019, QAQC = TRUE, output = 'short')
